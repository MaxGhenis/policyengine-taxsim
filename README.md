# policyengine-taxsim
TAXSIM emulator using the PolicyEngine US federal and state tax calculator

## How to use the emulator ##
The emulator takes a .raw file in the form of a csv. This is the same form of input that Taxsim-35 takes.

In terminal, run python3 /Path/to/taxsim_emulator.py /Path/to/your/input_file.raw 

### Example ##
input:

If the emulator and input file are in the current working directory, run:

python3 taxsim_emulator.py taxsim_input.raw
